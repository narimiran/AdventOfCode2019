## Solutions, highlights and thoughts

My first time solving AoC puzzles in OCaml from the get-go.
(I've used OCaml for [AoC 2017](https://github.com/narimiran/AdventOfCode2017),
but only after I've solved all tasks with other languages first -- as a preparation for this year.)

To keep this readme at a reasonable vertical size when rendered,
highlights and thoughts for each day are hidden behind the "details" flag.
Click on it if you want to read my ramblings.


### Day 1

[The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation](http://adventofcode.com/2019/day/1) || [day01.ml](ocaml/day01.ml) || Runtime: 0.6 ms

<details>

We have two slightly different functions (`f`) for each part, so counting the total boils down to:
```ocaml
List.fold_left (fun acc x -> acc + f x) 0
```

</details>



### Day 2

[1202 Program Alarm](http://adventofcode.com/2019/day/2) || [day02.ml](ocaml/day02.ml) || Runtime: 0.9 ms

<details>

Our inputs are such that there is no need to iterate through all possible `verb`s,
we can always leave `verb` at zero and later on calculate it from the difference between the desired and given output.
```ocaml
let result = intcode |> set_up [(1, noun)] |> run in
let verb = output - result in
if verb < 100 then
  100 * noun + verb
```

</details>



### Day 3

[Crossed Wires](http://adventofcode.com/2019/day/3) || [day03.ml](ocaml/day03.ml) || Runtime: 50 ms

<details>

Initial idea was to create a `Map` for every wire and then to find intersections via `Map.merge`:
```ocaml
let path_a = follow wire_a
let path_b = follow wire_b

let intersections = find_intersections path_a path_b

let () =
  intersections |> find closest;
  intersections |> find shortest
```
Although elegant, it was very inefficient. (Runtime around 180 ms)

Current solution treats wires differently:
The first wire is used to populate a `Hashtbl` with all visited points as keys and the number of steps taken as values.
The second wire is used only to check for intersections.
This gives 3.5x performance boost.
```ocaml
let () =
  wire_a |> visit_all_points;
  wire_b |> find_intersections;

  intersections |> find closest;
  intersections |> find shortest
```

</details>



### Day 4

[Secure Container](http://adventofcode.com/2019/day/4) || [day04.ml](ocaml/day04.ml) || Runtime: 0.6 ms

<details>

The initial solution iterated through the whole range between `low` and `high`,
converting each number to `String` or `OSeq` (I've tried both versions):
```ocaml
let solve ~part =
  let f = if part = 1 then ( >= ) else ( = ) in
  let res = ref 0 in
  for i = low to high do
    let sq = String.to_seq (string_of_int i) in
    if not_decr sq then
      let groups = sq |> OSeq.group ~eq:Char.equal in
      if OSeq.exists (fun g -> f (OSeq.length g) 2) groups then incr res
  done;
  !res
```
This had 1.3 **b**illion instructions and its runtime was around 130 ms.

Current solution is much uglier: it has six for-loops to iterate on each digit,
where lower bound for each digit is dependant on the digit before it.
Also, we iterate over potential candidates only once, and test for both parts:
```ocaml
let digit_groups = [ a; b; c; d; e; f ] |> group_lengths in
if digit_groups |> has_multiples then incr part_1;
if digit_groups |> has_duplicates then incr part_2
```
where `group_lengths` is a specialised and optimized version of `CCList.group_succ`
just for this task:
No unnecessary creations of lists of groups and `List.rev`,
we're interested only in number of members of each group of the same digit:
```ocaml
let group_lengths l =
  let rec aux acc cur amnt l =
    match cur, l with
    | _, [] -> amnt :: acc
    | y, x :: tl when Int.equal x y -> aux acc x (amnt+1) tl
    | _, x :: tl -> aux (amnt :: acc) x 1 tl
  in
  aux [] 0 0 l
```

The result of changing the algorithm and applying these micro-optimisations?
900k instructions (1500 times less than original!) and its runtime is 0.6 ms.
If it is ugly but it works... :)

Bonus: the main function looks like `>>=`.

### Day 5

[Sunny with a Chance of Asteroids](http://adventofcode.com/2019/day/5) || [day05.ml](ocaml/day05.ml) || Runtime: 0.7 ms

<details>

Below are the notes from the original version of `day05.ml`, together with the bug that
had bit me later on Day 9 (`let dest = a.(ip+3)`).
After Day 9 was released, the common logic from days 2, 5, 7 and 9 was extracted to
`intcode` module, and the solutions for those days were vastly simplified.
(See ["Intcode int'mezzo"](#intcode-intmezzo) below for more details.)

----

After you finally manage to read and understand what the instructions want from you,
the task becomes quite straight-forward.
Not counting the warm-up task on Day 1, I would say this was the easiest one so far:
Take Day 2, add new opcodes, change some details, and you're done.

Our "intcode computer" is starting to evolve and soon enough (but not yet)
these things should be probably put in a separate module which will be used by multiple tasks.

The initial solution had 8 separate branches for 8 separate opcodes.
Simple and straightforward, but lots of unnecessary duplication:
I've noticed that I can group together opcodes 1&2, 5&6, and 7&8 â€”
the only difference between them was the function/operation involved,
so the logical thing to do was to define custom operator for each group:
```ocaml
let ( +|* ) = if op = 1 then ( + ) else ( * ) in
a.(dest) <- n +|* v

let ( <>|= ) = if op = 5 then ( <> ) else ( = ) in
if n <>|= 0 then v else ip+3

let ( <|= ) = if op = 7 then ( < ) else ( = ) in
a.(dest) <- if n <|= v then 1 else 0
```

Operation deduplication half way done.
Groups 1&2 and 7&8 still had a lot of things in common
(they both read two parameters, have the same destination location (`ip+3`), do the same jump (`ip+4`))
so in the end they were put in the same branch to cut duplicated stuff some more:
```ocaml
let noun = read_param 1 in
match a.(ip) mod 100 with
| 1 | 2 | 7 | 8 as op ->
  let verb = read_param 2 in
  let dest = a.(ip+3) in
  a.(dest) <-
    (match op with
     | 1 -> noun + verb
     | 2 -> noun * verb
     | 7 -> CCBool.to_int (noun < verb)
     | 8 -> CCBool.to_int (noun = verb)
     | _ -> failwith "ocaml, you silly");
  ip+4
```

Yes I've removed some of the custom operators defined above, so some duplication is reintroduced.
I find it more readable this way.

</details>



### Day 6

[Universal Orbit Map](http://adventofcode.com/2019/day/6) || [day06.ml](ocaml/day06.ml) || Runtime: 3 ms

<details>

Ungh! Quest for my future self:
can you understand all the functions your previous self has written here?

We go through the input and create two `Map`s, one (used for the first part of the task)
containing `parent -> children` relationships (called `p2c`),
and the other containing `kid -> parent` relationships (called `k2p`) for the second part.

Part 1 is the recursive traversal through `"COM"`'s children, their children,
their children's children, ... counting the total distance to `"COM"`:
```ocaml
let rec traverse n key =
  match children with
  | [] -> n
  | _ ->
    let children_distances = List.map (traverse (n+1)) children in
    n + List.fold_left (+) 0 children_distances
```

The second part first builds the list of all ancestors for `"YOU"` and `"SAN"`:
```ocaml
let rec traverse relations acc = function
  | "COM" -> acc
  | kid ->
    let parent = relations |> RelationMap.find kid in
    traverse relations (parent::acc) parent
```

Both of those lists start with `"COM"` and all the common ancestors for both `"YOU"` and `"SAN"`.
We need to remove those, and what remains is the answer for the second part:
```ocaml
let rec calc_orbital_transfers you san =
  match you, san with
  | x::xs, y::ys when x = y -> calc_orbital_transfers xs ys
  | _, _ -> List.length you + List.length san
```

### Intcode int'mezzo

[intcode.ml](ocaml/lib/intcode.ml)

<details>

From Day 5 notes:

> Our "intcode computer" is starting to evolve and soon enough (but not yet)
> these things should be probably put in a separate module which will be used
> by multiple tasks.

The refactoring time has come.

When Day 7 was released, I wasn't at home so I couldn't solve it at that time.
I've read the task and realised that my current implementation from Day 5 won't fit for it,
I would need to refactor it so the state between runs remains preserved.

In the mean time, Day 9 was released, and with it our "intcode computer" implementation
is complete.
A perfect time to extract all the useful functions in a separate module.

Our computer can be in three states:
1. running - executing instructions until one of two things happen:
2. waiting - computer's input queue is empty and it can't continue until it receives an input
3. halted - computer has reached intcode 99

The computer is now represented as a `record`:
```ocaml
type state = Running | Waiting | Halted

type computer = {
  ram : int array;
  ip : int;
  rp : int;
  state : state;
  in_queue : int Queue.t;
  out_queue : int Queue.t;
}
```
where `ip` and `rp` are instruction and relative pointers, respectively, and
`in_queue` and `out_queue` are FIFO queues.

Computer initialization supports specifying arbitrary RAM size (with the 4096 as the default).
```ocaml
let initialize_computer ?(ram_size=4096) instructions =
  let ram = initialize_memory ram_size instructions in
  let in_queue = Queue.create () in
  let out_queue = Queue.create () in
  { ram; ip = 0; rp = 0; state = Running; in_queue; out_queue }
```

We can write to `in_queue` and read from `out_queue`, either the next output value
(days 7, 9, 11) or the last value in the queue (Day 5).
```ocaml
let receive value comp =
  Queue.add value comp.in_queue;
  comp

let get_next_output comp =
  Queue.take comp.out_queue

let get_last_output comp =
  comp.out_queue
  |> Queue.to_seq
  |> OSeq.reduce (fun _ v -> v)
```

When the computer has stopped (either waiting or halted), the whole state is
returned as different tasks need different values from it.
```ocaml
let run_until_halt comp =
  let rec run comp =
    match comp.state with
    | Halted | Waiting -> comp
    | Running -> comp |> execute_opcode |> run
  in
  { comp with state = Running } |> run
```

### Day 7

[Amplification Circuit](http://adventofcode.com/2019/day/7) || [day07.ml](ocaml/day07.ml) || Runtime: 50 ms

<details>

Now that [my intcode module](ocaml/lib/intcode.ml) is complete, the main problem
of this task becomes how to repeatedly loop through the amplifiers until one
of them halts.

[`CCList.fold_map`](https://c-cube.github.io/ocaml-containers/dev/containers/CCList/index.html#val-fold_map)
proved to be very useful for this:
It takes an accumulator (just like the regular `fold_left`), which in our case is
the output of the previous computer/amplifier; and it returns a tuple containing
both the accumulator and the modified list (like `map`), which are our computers/amplifiers
after they had run this time.
We need both of those outputs.

Using that function, we can recursively run all of our computers until one of them halted:
```ocaml
let rec get_output (score, computers) =
  if some_halted computers then score
  else
    computers
    |> CCList.fold_map
      (fun last_output comp ->
         let comp' =
           comp
           |> Intcode.receive last_output
           |> Intcode.run_until_halt in
         comp'.output, comp')
      score
    |> get_output
```

With that in place, finding the solution for both parts is just a matter of running
all the permutations of phase settings, and finding the maximal output:
```ocaml
let solve =
  permutations
  %> List.fold_left
    (fun acc perm ->
       let computers = create_computers perm in
       (0, computers) |> get_output |> max acc)
    0
```

### Day 8

[Space Image Format](http://adventofcode.com/2019/day/8) || [day08.ml](ocaml/day08.ml) || Runtime: 2 ms

<details>

This is an easy one after Day 7, which was the hardest one so far for me.

The first part is boring:
We count the number of each digit per layer, and find the layer with the fewest zeros.

The second part is more interesting.
For each pixel, we recursively try to find its color, starting from the top-most
layer and until we reach a layer with a non-transparent pixel.
Not a very efficient way of doing things (we repeatedly go through the list of layers,
and then for each layer we go to `nth` pixel), but it wins for its simplicity:
```ocaml
let rec pixel_color layers pixel =
  match layers with
  | [] -> failwith "pixel is transparent"
  | layer :: below ->
    (match List.nth layer pixel with
     | '0' -> ' '
     | '1' -> '#'
     | '2' -> pixel_color below pixel
     | _ -> failwith "invalid input")
```

</details>



### Day 9

[Sensor Boost](http://adventofcode.com/2019/day/9) || [day09.ml](ocaml/day09.ml) || Runtime: 21 ms

<details>

This task has brought a relative pointer (`rp`) and a new mode (`2`):
```ocaml
  match mode with
  | 0 -> param_val
  | 1 -> ip + param
  | 2 -> rp + param_val
```

With that in place, the [intcode computer](ocaml/lib/intcode.ml) is now complete.

This felt even easier than Day 5.
